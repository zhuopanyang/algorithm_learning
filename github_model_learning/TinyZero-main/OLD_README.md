<h1 style="text-align: center;">veRL: Volcano Engine Reinforcement Learning for LLM</h1>

veRL is a flexible, efficient and production-ready RL training framework designed for large language models (LLMs). 

veRL is the open-source version of **[HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256v2)** paper.

veRL is flexible and easy to use with:

- **Easy extension of diverse RL algorithms**: The Hybrid programming model combines the strengths of single-controller and multi-controller paradigms to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of complex Post-Training dataflows. Allowing users to build RL dataflows in a few lines of code.

- **Seamless integration of existing LLM infra with modular APIs**: Decouples computation and data dependencies, enabling seamless integration with existing LLM frameworks, such as PyTorch FSDP, Megatron-LM and vLLM. Moreover, users can easily extend to other LLM training and inference frameworks.

- **Flexible device mapping**: Supports various placement of models onto different sets of GPUs for efficient resource utilization and scalability across different cluster sizes.

- Readily integration with popular HuggingFace models


veRL is fast with:

- **State-of-the-art throughput**: By seamlessly integrating existing SOTA LLM training and inference frameworks, veRL achieves high generation and training throughput.

- **Efficient actor model resharding with 3D-HybridEngine**: Eliminates memory redundancy and significantly reduces communication overhead during transitions between training and generation phases.
